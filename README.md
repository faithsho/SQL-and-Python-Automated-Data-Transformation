# SQL-and-Python-Automated-Data-Transformation

This is a very simple project, and the goal was to read data from multiple columns in an excel sheet and transform it into a simplified two-column structure. The data was originally stored in an Excel sheet, where columns were grouped in pairs (e.g., columns C and D, E and F, etc.). The task was to copy each pair of columns and insert the data into a database in the form of two columns, `col_A` and `col_B`.

- The task was executed in python and later done in SQL
